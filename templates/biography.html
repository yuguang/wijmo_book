    <p>He is currently working as a research engineer at the University of Waterloo on a project called  <a target="_blank"href="https://datamill.uwaterloo.ca/about/">DataMill</a>. It is a community-based easy to use service oriented benchmarking infrastructure for performance evaluation. As the main system administrator and developer of the team he installs Gentoo Linux on computers, develops distributed software to run on master and worker nodes, and programs interactive user interfaces. Wijmo's slider integration with Knockout has helped tremendously in developing the experiment submission form, where range sliders are used to select lower and upper bounds for factors such as page size, clock speed, and core count. As the web developer on the team, he programs in Python and CoffeeScript using the Django framework. </p>
